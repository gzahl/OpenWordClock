Wordclock. I wanted one. But they were so very expensive. So I build my own.

This Clock reads out the current time for you in words. This is achieved by shining LEDs through a mask with cutouts of specific letters, that form the words to display a time.

In the terms of this project, I was able to teach myself a variety of tools techniques, including, but not limited to:
- the arduino platform incl. ATMega328P
- CAD design
- PCB design
- 3D-Printing
- Laser cutting
- Foil plotting

## Features
- Display 12h time
- 102 colors plus white
- Automatic color cycling
- Brightness setting
- dynamic brightness

### in development
- Nightmode (display off at night)

### planned
- Multicolor support
- Language support (EN)
- Seconds display

## Contributors
The electrical and mechanical design, C++ and python code, and features have mainly been developped by me, Jacob NÃ¼rnberg. Thanks go to various colleages for the numerous discussions on implementation details and support with 3D-printed pards, electrical components and implementation specific questions.
