Body
----

While of-the-shelf components are used for most part of OpenWordClock, the body is make up of many custom design parts. So before starting with the assembly, the custom parts have to be manufactured. 

Custom parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The body consists of custom designed slotted components from 3 mm thick MDF. These components are designed to be laser cut from a single sheet of 900 mm x 600 mm stock material. These measurements are supported by most commercially available laser cutters. As stock material, one can either use uncoated MDF, however using white painted MDF results in a nice internal and external surface finish and can usually be purchased at your local hardware store. Make sure to buy the variant with both sides painted.

For laser cutting, figure out, if you can find a local makerspace of fablab with a suitable laser cutting tool near you. Usually, you can go there and laser cut your stock material yourself in exchange for a small support for the makerspace. Also consult with the local staff, more often than not, they are able and willing to provide valuable support on their tool, such as on cutting parameters and material dependent settings. 

Once cut, clean the components with a little soap water and remove any laser cutting residue or burn marks. Make sure not to soak the components (MFD will swell and deform when in contact with water) and let them properly dry afterwards.

For the 3D-printed corner blocks, you an also consult with your local makerspace. It is rather common to find a 3D-printer there. Another possibility would be a colleague or friend in possession of a printer. Or you may even own one yourself. 

I printed my parts in PLA, however, any other thermoplastic should work as well. Make sure though to use a reformable thermoplastic, as after the print, heat set threaded inserts will be installed to allow for mounting.

Now, that you have all custom parts, it's time to start the assembly of the body.
