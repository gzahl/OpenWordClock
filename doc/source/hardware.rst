Hardware and assembly
=====================

Here you find all information about the hardware, where to source the individual components and how to assemble your very own OpenWordClock.

The first section goes over all parts, that are needed to build an OpenWordClock. Here, you find material information, specific part numbers and where to source them. It also covers custom laser cut parts and 3D printed components. 

The following sections discuss the assembly of the OpenWordClock, starting with the body, followed by logic board and electronics with the last section being the front panel of the clock. This corresponds to the logical order of assembly. However, it is absolutely possible to work on multiple parts simultaneously, i.e. when waiting for other components to arrive.
