OpenWordClock
=============

OpenWordClock is a fully open source wordclock that can be realised with hobbyist tools and capabilities.

The project repository is hosted on `GitLab <https://gitlab.com/JacobNuernberg/openwordclock>`_.

I always fancied owning an official `Qlocktwo <https://qlocktwo.com/>`_, however found them to be rather expensive. On the other hand I was fascinated by the idea to realize one as my own project. When I then came to know about a makerspace near me with the capabilities of laser cutting and 3D-printing, I set out to realize my idea. 

My aim throughout this project was to design it in such a way, that any hobbyist with a basic skill set and the will to learn new things could realize this project. The body work is laser cut or 3D-printed, the electronics are off the shelf components and the source code is build in the `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_ environment.
