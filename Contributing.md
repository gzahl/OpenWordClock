 # Contributing

 At this early point, there is not a fixed guide for contributing to this project. I am happy about any suggestions, inspirations, code snippets, pull requests etc.

 I appreciate any contributions. As a hobbyist, I cannot track and trace every contribution to a personal user. I therefore reserve the right to implement, reuse, adapt and further develop any code that is contributed in this or any other project.

 Nontheless, I want to give a few basic rules, that I kindly ask you to follow.

 ## Basic Rules
 1. You can contribute by forking this project and creating a pull request.
 2. Always create a branch related to the topic you start working on. For convenctions on branch naming [[branch naming | branch-naming]], see below.
 3. Never work on the main branch. Pull requests to main will be rejected.
 4. Comment on your changes, be precise and punctual. Argue, why these changes should be made. Uncommented and unexplained pull requests will be rejected.

## Branch Naming
Chose a short and descriptive name for your branch. Categorize it, by following the naming examples below: the category is the first part of the branch name, followed by a `/`. If you cannot find a suitable category, feel free to think of your on.

- For feature developments, use `feature/<descriptive branch name>`
- For other, more general developments, use `dev/<descriptive branch name>`
- For bug fixes related to tracked issues, use `issue/<gitlab issue number>`
- For untracked bugs, use `bug/<descriptive branch name>`
- For code review, use `review/<descriptive branch name>`
